# presentation-spark-101
This repo contains examples on getting started with spark. Check out apache spark website for more info. https://spark.apache.org/

## Goals of the presentation:
1. Apache Spark - The idea of this presentation is to give folks who have heard of Spark but not have worked on it a chance to see it in action, give an intro on what can be done and help them start to experiment with it
2. Talk a little theory - This presentation is limited to the working of Spark, we will not go into the Machine Learning aspects of spark just into the data aspects, Spark SQL and ETL related. 
    -- How does the RDD get formed ?
    -- How does dispersion and collection happen ?
    -- What is going on under the hood ?
3. Demo 1 - Counting all the words in a Text file
4. Demo 2 - This will be the wine recommendation example
5. Demo 3 - This could be a streaming example

Presentation time is going to be 40 mins.
